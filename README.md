This will give the solutions for Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) problems using Python as well as the test cases.

## About CCC
The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is a fun challenge for participants with an interest in programming. Designed to be both accessible to participants with some programming experience and to challenge the keenest programmers at the secondary school level, the CCC helps participants build confidence and grow their ability to design, understand and implement algorithms.

## Run Test Cases
Make sure `pytest` has been installed.
```
$ pytest --version
```
Install `pytest` if it wasn't installed.
```
pip install -U pytest
```

Either run all test cases from project directory,
```
pytest
```
or run test cases in one test file, e.g.
```
cd 2023
cd junior
pytest problem_1_test.py
```
